The goal of this challenge is the classification of 9 regularly misidentified cell lines based on microscopy images. The classes to distinguish are PC-3, U-251 MG, HeLa, A549, U-2 OS, MCF7, HEK 293, CACO-2 and RT4. Each sample contains at least one cell and consists of 3 seperate images showing different parts (nucleus, microtubules, endoplasmic reticulum) of the same cell.
